# Weather Observation Station 1  
  
Query a list of CITY and STATE from the STATION table.  
  
***Input Format***  
  
The STATION table is described as follows:  
  
![img](https://s3.amazonaws.com/hr-challenge-images/9336/1449345840-5f0a551030-Station.jpg)  
  
where LAT_N is the northern latitude and LONG_W is the western longitude.  
  
	SELECT city, state FROM station;  
  
  
  
# Weather Observation Station 3  
  
Query a list of CITY names from STATION with even ID numbers only. You may print the results in any order, but must exclude duplicates from your answer.  
  
	SELECT DISTINCT city FROM station WHERE MOD(id, 2) = 0;  
  
  
  
# Weather Observation Station 4  
  
Let N be the number of CITY entries in STATION, and let N' be the number of distinct CITY names in STATION; query the value N-N' of from STATION. In other words, find the difference between the total number of CITY entries in the table and the number of distinct CITY entries in the table.  
  
	SELECT COUNT(city) - COUNT(DISTINCT(city)) FROM station;   
  
  
  
# Weather Observation Station 5  
  
Query the two cities in STATION with the shortest and longest CITY names, as well as their respective lengths (i.e.: number of characters in the name). If there is more than one smallest or largest city, choose the one that comes first when ordered alphabetically.  
  
***Sample Input***  
  
Let's say that CITY only has four entries: DEF, ABC, PQRS and WXY  
  
***Sample Output***   
  
ABC 3  
PQRS 4  
  
***Explanation***  
  
When ordered alphabetically, the CITY names are listed as ABC, DEF, PQRS, and WXY, with the respective lengths 3, 3, 4 and 3. The longest-named city is obviously PQRS, but there are 3 options for shortest-named city; we choose ABC, because it comes first alphabetically.  
  
	SELECT * FROM (SELECT DISTINCT city, LENGTH(city) FROM station ORDER BY LENGTH(city) ASC, city ASC) WHERE ROWNUM = 1   
	UNION  
	SELECT * FROM (SELECT DISTINCT city, LENGTH(city) FROM station ORDER BY LENGTH(city) DESC, city ASC) WHERE ROWNUM = 1;  
  
  
  
# Weather Observation Station 6

# Weather Observation Station 7  
  
Query the list of CITY names ending with vowels (a, e, i, o, u) from STATION. Your result cannot contain duplicates.
  
	SELECT DISTINCT city FROM station WHERE city LIKE '%a' OR city LIKE '%e' OR city LIKE '%i' OR city LIKE '%o' OR city LIKE '%u';  
  
  
  
# Weather Observation Station 8  
  
Query the list of CITY names from STATION which have vowels (i.e., a, e, i, o, and u) as both their first and last characters. Your result cannot contain duplicates.  
  
  use one of syntax bellow:

     Or
SELECT distinct City FROM STATION WHERE City LIKE '[A,E,I,O,U]%[A,E,I,O,U]';
  
  
  
# Weather Observation Station 9  
  
Query the list of CITY names from STATION that do not start with vowels. Your result cannot contain duplicates.

	OR (city LIKE '%a' OR city LIKE '%e' OR city LIKE '%i' OR city LIKE '%o' OR city LIKE '%u'));
  
  
  
# Higher Than 75 Marks  
  
Query the Name of any student in STUDENTS who scored higher than 75 Marks. Order your output by the last three characters of each name. If two or more students both have names ending in the same last three characters (i.e.: Bobby, Robby, etc.), secondary sort them by ascending ID.  
  
***Input Format*** 
  
The STUDENTS table is described as follows:

***Sample Output***  
  
Ashley  
Julia  
Belvet  
  
***Explanation***  
  
Only Ashley, Julia, and Belvet have Marks > 75. If you look at the last three characters of each of their names, there are no duplicates and 'ley' < 'lia' < 'vet'.   
  
	SELECT name FROM students WHERE marks > 75 ORDER BY SUBSTR(name, LENGTH(name)-2, 3), id;
